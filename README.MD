# House Price Prediction Project: Step-by-Step Guide

## Overview
This guide outlines the step-by-step procedure to achieve the milestone of predicting house prices using a combination of Linear Regression and Random Forest models. The approach includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and preparing the final submission.

## Steps

### 1. Data Loading
- Load the training and test datasets from CSV files.
- Inspect the data to understand its structure and identify missing values.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
#### Handling Missing Values
- Identify categorical and numerical columns.
- Replace missing values in categorical columns with the mode (most frequent value).
- Replace missing values in numerical columns with the median value.

#### Feature Selection
- Select relevant features based on their correlation with the target variable (SalePrice).

### 3. Data Splitting
- Split the training data into training and validation sets to evaluate model performance.

### 4. Data Standardization
- Standardize the selected features to have zero mean and unit variance, which is crucial for some models like Linear Regression.

### 5. Model Training and Evaluation
#### Linear Regression
- Train a Linear Regression model using the training data.
- Predict house prices on the validation set.
- Calculate evaluation metrics: RMSE, MSE, MAE, and R-squared.

#### Random Forest Regressor
- Train a Random Forest Regressor using the training data.
- Predict house prices on the validation set.
- Calculate the same set of evaluation metrics as for Linear Regression.

#### Ensemble Method
- Combine the predictions of Linear Regression and Random Forest models by averaging them.
- Evaluate the ensemble predictions using the same metrics.

### 6. Model Predictions on Test Data
- Standardize the test data using the same scaler fitted on the training data.
- Predict house prices for the test data using both models.
- Combine the predictions from both models using the ensemble method.

### 7. Prepare Submission File
- Add the predicted SalePrice to the test data DataFrame.
- Save the entire test data DataFrame, including the predictions, to a CSV file for submission.

### 8. Model Evaluation Metrics Explained
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** Measures the average magnitude of the errors between predicted and actual values.
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error):** The average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values.
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** The average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values.
- **R-squared (R2):** Indicates how well the model explains the variability of the target variable.

## Conclusion
Following these steps will ensure a structured and effective approach to predicting house prices using machine learning models. The final output will be a CSV file containing the test data along with the predicted house prices, ready for submission.
